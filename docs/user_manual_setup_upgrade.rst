Upgrading
=========

.. index:: upgrade;

It is possible to copy configuration settings from a previous installation.
When a new installation is performed, the user is prompted (see :numref:`existing_setup`) to select existing configuration
settings (if any).

.. _existing_setup:
.. figure:: ./_static/existing_setup.png
    :width: 470px
    :align: center
    :alt: alternate text
    :figclass: align-center

    Select the desired setup and click on the *OK* button to copy an existing setup.
